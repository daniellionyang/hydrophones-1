ARM Math Library
================

This is the CMSIS-DSP library source code, also commonly called the arm_math.h library.

This code may **only be used with microprocessors manufactured or simulated under license from ARM**.  See CMSIS_LICENSE.pdf for details.

The intended purpose of this github repository is development of a new makefile or build script to compile this library using modern version of the arm-none-eabi-gcc toolchain with alternate parameters, such as function sections and link time optimization.  These alternate compiler parameters are needed for the development of Tools to be used solely for the purpose of developing software programs for use with microprocessors manufactured or simulated under license from ARM.
